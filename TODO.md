# TODO: Define Character Class
# Create a Python class named "Character" to represent DnD 5E characters.
# Include attributes such as name, race, class, level, abilities, hit points, etc.

# TODO: Implement Character Creation
# Write functions to guide users through creating new characters for DnD 5E.
# Prompt users for necessary information like name, race, class, etc.
# Instantiate a new Character object with the provided information.

# TODO: Ability Score Generation
# Develop a method within the Character class to generate ability scores following DnD 5E rules.
# Utilize methods such as rolling dice (e.g., 4d6 drop lowest) for generating these scores.

# TODO: Calculate Modifier
# Implement a function or method to calculate ability score modifiers for characters.
# Use the character's ability scores to determine modifiers following DnD 5E rules.

# TODO: Combat System
# Design and implement a basic combat system adhering to DnD 5E mechanics.
# Include calculations for hit chance, damage, critical hits, etc.

# TODO: Leveling Up
# Define rules for characters to gain experience points and level up according to DnD 5E rules.
# Implement a mechanism for characters to level up their abilities as they gain experience.

# TODO: Saving and Loading Characters
# Create functions to save characters to a file and load them back into the program.
# Ensure the saved data includes all relevant character information for seamless continuation.

# TODO: User Interface (Optional)
# If desired, develop a simple user interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for enhanced user interaction.
# Make it intuitive and user-friendly for smooth navigation and character management.

# TODO: Testing and Debugging
# Thoroughly test the code to verify its correctness and reliability.
# Debug any errors or unexpected behavior encountered during testing to ensure robustness.

# TODO: Documentation
# Document the code comprehensively with comments and docstrings following best practices.
# Provide clear explanations and examples to aid understanding and future development.
